# Dhaka-Finance-Navigator
AI &amp; data science project exploring stock market of Bangladesh

[Content start here]


🚀 Project Vision: Applied Economics in an Emerging Market

This  project is dedicated to building and rigorously testing an advanced Artificial Intelligence system for analyzing stock movements on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). The Dhaka Finance Navigator (DFN) system integrates two primary forecasting methodologies:

Time Series Forecasting: Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning networks on historical price and volume data.

Sentiment Integration: Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify market sentiment from local Bengali financial news headlines.

The core goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can provide data-driven insights and superior predictive performance compared to traditional econometric models (like ARIMA) within the context of an emerging financial market.

📊 Current Status: Foundation & Data Acquisition

Metric

Detail

Date Started

December 1, 2025

Current Phase

Foundation & Data Acquisition (Month 1 Starting)

Next Milestone

Establish Python environment and acquire initial DSE historical data.

🛠️ Technical Stack & Environment

The DFN project is developed entirely using zero-cost, open-source tools:

Language: Python 3.x

Environment: Google Colab (for development and training)

Core Data Libraries: Pandas (DataFrames), NumPy (Numerical arrays)

Modeling Libraries: Planned: Statsmodels (ARIMA), TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)

Visualization: Planned: Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP/Sentiment: Planned: NLTK / spaCy (for Bengali text processing)

📈 Learning & Progress Log

This log documents weekly progress, technical challenges, and major milestones achieved.

Week

Date Range

Work Completed / Deliverables

Wk 1

Dec 1 - Dec 7, 2025

Goal: Establish Python environment, set up GitHub/Colab, and master Python basics (variables, functions, control flow).

Wk 2

Dec 8 - Dec 14, 2025

Goal: Find reliable DSE data sources, successfully import 5 years of historical data, and master basic NumPy array operations.

Wk 3

Dec 15 - Dec 21, 2025

Goal: Master Pandas for CSV import, indexing, data cleaning (handling nulls), and initial data type correction.

Wk 4

Dec 22 - Dec 28, 2025

Goal: Calculate necessary features (like Daily Return) and finalize the clean dataset (clean_dse_data.csv).

...

(Future weeks will document the implementation of ARIMA, LSTM, NLP, and final report generation.)



🎓 About This Project

As a high school student from Bangladesh with experience running a small business, I am building this project to explore how  computational techniques can provide data-driven insights for financial decision-making in local markets. This is both a comprehensive technical learning journey and a practical application of machine learning to real-world economic analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between financial theory and technology.
